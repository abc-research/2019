about:
  - text: "<b>Human Activity Recognition</b> has been researched in thousands of papers so far, with mobile / environmental sensors in ubiquitous / pervasive domains, and with cameras in vision domains. As well, <b>Human Behavior Analysis</b> is also explored for long-term health care, rehabilitation, emotion recognition, human interaction, and so on. However, many research challenges remain for realistic settings, such as complex and ambiguous activities / behavior, optimal sensor combinations, (deep) machine learning, data collection, platform systems, and killer applications."
  - text: "In this conference, we comprehend such research domains as <b>ABC</b>: <i>Activity and Behavior Computing</i>, and provide an open and a confluent place for discussing various aspects and the future of the ABC."
